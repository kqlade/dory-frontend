# Dory: Your Personal Web Memory Assistant

## What is Dory?

Dory is a browser extension that helps you remember and find everything you've read online. Just like the character Dory from Finding Nemo needed help remembering things, this extension acts as your digital memory for web content.

## How Does It Work?

### Automatic Content Saving
As you browse the web, Dory quietly works in the background to save the content of pages you visit. It's like having a personal librarian who takes snapshots of everything you read, making it easily searchable later.

### Smart Filtering
Dory is smart about what it saves:
- ‚úÖ It saves: Articles, blog posts, documentation, and meaningful content
- ‚ùå It skips: Login pages, image files, temporary pages, and other non-content pages

### Powerful Search
When you want to find something you've read before:
1. Open Dory
2. Type what you're looking for in natural language
3. Get relevant results from your browsing history

The search is intelligent - it understands the meaning of your question and finds relevant content, even if you don't remember the exact words or website.

## Why Use Dory?

### Never Lose Important Information
- Found a useful article but forgot to bookmark it? Dory has you covered.
- Can't remember where you read something? Just ask Dory.
- Need to reference something from weeks ago? It's all there.

### Save Time
- No need to manually bookmark everything
- No more digging through browser history
- No more "I know I read this somewhere..."

### Privacy-Focused
- Your data stays in your control
- No tracking or sharing of your browsing habits
- Works locally in your browser
